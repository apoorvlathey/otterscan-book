# Beacon chain support

Since *The Merge*, running a consensus layer node (CL) is required alongside the execution layer node (EL).

For merged chains, Otterscan can optionally display CL information.

- [Beacon chain support overview](./overview.md)

First you'll need to make sure your CL node is fully synced and then enable its REST API support.

- [Enabling CL REST API](./rest-api.md)

You can then enable it in Otterscan.

- [Enable CL integration](./otterscan.md)
