# ots2 namespace spec

> These are the docs for the experimental Otterscan v2 APIs. For Otterscan 1 APIs docs, click [here](./ots-api.md).

All those methods are subjected to be changed during Otterscan 2 alpha period, so we didn't put much effort into documenting them yet.

They are briefly described here so you can have a glimpse of what we aim to for future versions of Otterscan.

There may be more methods added, removed, merged, etc.

## Method summary

All methods are prefixed with the `ots2_` namespace in order to make it clear it is vendor-specific and there is no name clash with other same-name implementations.
